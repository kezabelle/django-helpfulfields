About django-helpfulfields
==========================

Mostly a collection of `Django`_ models, querysets, and admin stuff. Because
I'm tired of copy-pasting and tweaking the same bits over and over between
projects, so I'm trying to package up the pieces into a bunch of
reusable quasi-components, importable into any `Django`_ project.

Documentation
-------------

Exists in the `docs` directory. Eventually, I'll put it on `Read the docs`_,
but it needs to be installable into a *virtualenv* first.

Contributing
------------

There is a `GitHub`_ repository at `kezabelle/django-helpfulfields`_ which
is the canonical location for involvement. Use the app. Open issues.
