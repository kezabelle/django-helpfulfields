Re-usable Localising strings
============================

All the text strings we need to mark for translation are available here.
By putting them here, we can keep everything nice and tidy, and, bonus, we
don't have to jump through long-winded hoops to get the verbose_name from a
Model to be the label for an overridden Form field.
