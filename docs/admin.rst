Modeladmin helpers
==================

A collection of variables and objects for helping integrate the various `models`
into a Django :class:`~django.contrib.admin.AdminSite`.

.. admonition:: Re-usable callable class origins

    The various callable classes were inspired by work ``cdunklau`` in the
    #django IRC channel showed me, as demonstrated by code he
    released `into the public domain`_ `in a paste`_, where previously
    they would have been Mixin objects.
